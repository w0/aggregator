# aggreGator üêä

aggreGator (üêä) is a rss feed aggregator.

## Requirements

* golang 1.23+
* postgresql 15+

On macos I installed both golang and postgressql with homebrew.

```Shell
brew install postgresql@15 go
```

## Install gator

Run the following cmds to install aggregator into your $GOPATH

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/w0/aggregator.git
cd aggregator
go install
```

## PostgreSQL setup

On macos. Assuming you installed with homebrew.

Start by link postgresql into your path, enable the service and creating the db "gator".

```Shell
brew link postgresql@15 --force
brew services start postgresql@15

createdb "gator"

```

Now that you have created the database.
Lets perform a migration so it is setup like `aggregator` expects.

```Shell
# Install Goose
go install github.com/pressly/goose/v3/cmd/goose@latest

# Perform the up migration
goose postgres "postgres://$USER:@localhost:5432/gator" up -dir sql/schema/

```

## Create .gatorconfig.json

The .gatorconfig.json should be in your home directory.

```Shell
cat << EOF > ~/.gatorconfig.json
{"db_url":"postgres://$USER:@localhost:5432/gator?sslmode=disable","current_user_name":""}
EOF
```
